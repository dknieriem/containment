End of day

Group:

Adjust members stability by security level of their current sector (security level is a combination of zed count, group count, and structure modifiers, with any bonuses from character traits)

Members whose stability drops below a certain level will shut down, walk off, or go berserk. 

Zeds:

Hordes have a small chance to lose zeds, 
Can gain zeds at rate ( p * z * h), p = constant rate, z = num other zeds in sector, h = horde size

Hordes move as one, and give a 25% combat penalty to any groups in sector.

Individual zeds decay at a slow rate. Decay level sets their combat ability and chance of migration. Decayed past a certain point zeds will not join hordes (too slow), past another point will not migrate either
