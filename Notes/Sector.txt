Sector:

bool hasRoadNorth, hasRoadEast, hasRoadSouth, hasRoadWest
float Height (feet above sea level)
float deltaHeightN, E, S, W
int civLevel
int numBuildings


static float defaultSectorTravelSpeed = 3.0f; //(walking mph) 
travelSpeedNorth, E,S,W 


set each sector height based on worldgen,
get deltaHeight between sectors
get road connections between sectors
travelspeed between two sectors =
default * ( 1 - deltaHeight / 1000)  * ( 1 + hasRoad * 0.05)
